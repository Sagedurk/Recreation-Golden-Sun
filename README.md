# Recreation Golden Sun
Recreating mechanics from Golden Sun for educational purposes, to improve my problem solving skills
</br>
Developed primarily for PC with controller support, in **Unity 2020.2.7f1**

All code can be found in Assets/Scripts
</br>
The most important scripts can be found in Assets/Scripts/Systems
</br>
which is where you'll find *DialogueMaster*, *Interactable*, *InteractableEditor*, and *ChestMaster*

### Challenges
* Perfectly replicating the UI animation
* Understanding how to write a custom editor
* Making sense of the logic to the dialogue system
* Not relying on any external sources other than for documentation

### Future plans
* Creating all interactable systems
* Starting on overworld Psynergy use, such as puzzles 
* Replicate the different minigames found in one of the towns
* Undertaking the combat system and all that it entails (skill system, class system, etc.)
* Including more

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
Download Unity **2020.2.7f1** and open the project's root folder in Unity.
